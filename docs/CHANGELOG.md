### 🔌 External Integrations & Webhook Deduplication System - Production-Ready Integration Infrastructure

This release implements a **critical webhook deduplication system** for reliable external service integrations, ensuring production hosting provider operations never double-process events from Stripe, Virtualmin, or domain registrars.

### ✅ Added

#### **🔄 Webhook Deduplication Infrastructure (`apps/integrations/`)**
- **WebhookEvent Model** - Complete event tracking with deduplication
  - Unique constraints on `(source, event_id)` prevent duplicates
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (5m → 15m → 1h → 2h → 6h)
  - Comprehensive status tracking: `pending`, `processed`, `failed`, `skipped`
  - IP tracking, signature verification, payload storage
  - Performance indexes for queue processing

- **BaseWebhookProcessor** - Standardized webhook handling framework
  - HMAC signature verification utilities
  - Stripe signature validation with timestamp checks
  - Automatic retry scheduling with exponential backoff
  - Error handling and audit logging with emoji indicators

- **StripeWebhookProcessor** - Production-ready Stripe integration
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` → Update Payment status
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed` → Trigger dunning process  
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Update Invoice status
  - `charge.dispute.created` → Alert for manual review
  - `customer.created` → Link Stripe customer to Customer record

#### **🔧 Webhook Management Tools**
- **Management Command** - `python manage.py process_webhooks`
  - Process pending webhook queue with source filtering
  - Retry failed webhooks with intelligent scheduling
  - Cleanup old processed webhooks (>30 days)
  - Comprehensive statistics and monitoring

- **Admin Interface** - Professional webhook monitoring
  - Color-coded status indicators with emoji symbols
  - Processing duration tracking and payload size monitoring
  - Searchable by event ID, type, IP address, error messages
  - Quick retry actions for failed webhooks

- **API Endpoints** - Webhook status monitoring
  - `GET /integrations/api/webhooks/status/` - Statistics dashboard
  - `POST /integrations/api/webhooks/<id>/retry/` - Manual retry
  - Real-time processing metrics by source

#### **🛡️ Production Reliability Features**
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Prevents double-processing of retried webhooks
- **Signature Verification** - Stripe webhook signature validation with replay protection
- **Audit Trail** - Complete webhook processing history with error details
- **Monitoring Ready** - Statistics API for external monitoring systems
- **Queue Processing** - Batch processing with configurable limits

### 🔗 Integration Points

#### **External Service Endpoints**
```
POST /integrations/webhooks/stripe/     → Stripe payment events
POST /integrations/webhooks/virtualmin/ → Server management events  
POST /integrations/webhooks/paypal/     → PayPal payment events
```

#### **Management & Monitoring**
```
GET  /integrations/api/webhooks/status/           → Processing statistics
POST /integrations/api/webhooks/<id>/retry/       → Manual retry
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

#### **Why Dedicated Deduplication System?**
- **Production Reliability** - Hosting providers cannot afford duplicate provisioning
- **Stripe Requirements** - Payment processing demands idempotent webhook handling
- **Scaling Preparation** - Framework supports multiple external services
- **Audit Compliance** - Complete processing history for financial reconciliation

#### **Separation of Concerns**
- **`apps/billing/`** - Business logic (what payments do)
- **`apps/integrations/`** - Technical plumbing (how external services communicate)
- **Future: `apps/domains/`** - Domain business logic
- **Future: `apps/integrations/registrars/`** - Registrar API calls

### 🧪 Testing Verified

#### **Deduplication Effectiveness**
```bash
# Test webhook processing
✅ First webhook: evt_test_webhook_123 → processed
✅ Duplicate webhook: evt_test_webhook_123 → skipped (deduplication works!)
```

#### **Management Command Functionality**
```bash
python manage.py process_webhooks --stats     # Show processing statistics
python manage.py process_webhooks --pending   # Process pending queue
python manage.py process_webhooks --retry     # Retry failed webhooks
python manage.py process_webhooks --cleanup   # Clean old records
```

### 📊 Database Schema Impact

#### **New Tables Added**
- `webhook_event` - Event deduplication and processing tracking
- `webhook_delivery` - Outgoing customer webhook deliveries
- Optimized indexes for queue processing and monitoring

### 🚀 Production Readiness

#### **For Hosting Providers**

- **Automatic Retry Logic** - Handles temporary service outages
- **Complete Audit Trail** - Financial reconciliation and compliance
- **Monitoring Integration** - Statistics API for external monitoring

#### **For Development Teams**

```bash
# Stripe webhook configuration
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_stripe_webhook_secret_here

# Optional: webhook processing limits
WEBHOOK_PROCESSING_LIMIT=100
WEBHOOK_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
```

### 📈 Performance Characteristics

#### **Queue Processing**
- **Batch Size** - Default 100 webhooks per run
- **Retry Strategy** - Exponential backoff prevents service overload
- **Database Optimizations** - Indexes for pending/failed webhook queries
- **Memory Efficiency** - Processes webhooks individually to prevent memory bloat
