### Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This release contains critical security improvements for two-factor authentication. If you are upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Set Encryption Key**: Add `DJANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable before migrating
   ```bash
   # Generate a key:
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

2. **Run Migration**: The database migration will encrypt existing 2FA secrets
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **User Action Required**: Users with existing 2FA may need to re-setup if encryption key is not available during migration

4. **Admin Training**: Inform support staff about new admin 2FA management tools

5. **Development Setup**: Use automatic .env file loading for local development
   ```bash
   # .env file automatically loaded by manage.py
   echo "DJANGO_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
   ```
