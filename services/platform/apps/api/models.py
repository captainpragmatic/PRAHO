# API MODELS - MINIMAL PLACEHOLDER ðŸ“Š
# ===============================================================================
#
# This file exists to satisfy Django's app structure requirements.
# API-specific models (rate limiting, API keys, etc.) can be added here later.
#
# For now, all business data models remain in their domain apps:
#   - Customer data: apps.customers.models
#   - Billing data: apps.billing.models
#   - Ticket data: apps.tickets.models
#

from django.db import models

# Future API-specific models can be added here:
# - APIKey model for API authentication
# - RateLimit model for per-user rate limiting
# - APILog model for request/response logging
# - APIVersion model for version management
