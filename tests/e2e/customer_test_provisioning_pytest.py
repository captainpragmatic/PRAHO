CUSTOMER PROVISIONING ACCESS CONTROL - END-TO-END TESTS
===============================================================================

Security-focused E2E testing for provisioning system from customer perspective.
Validates that customers cannot access staff-only provisioning functionality.

Test Coverage:
- Direct URL access attempts (should be blocked)
- Service management action attempts (suspend, activate, edit)
- Service creation attempts (should be blocked) 
- Server and plan management access (should be blocked)
- Proper error messages and redirects
- Security boundaries and access control validation

Expected Behavior:
- Customers should be redirected with "Staff privileges required" message
- All provisioning management functions should be inaccessible
- Proper security controls prevent unauthorized access
