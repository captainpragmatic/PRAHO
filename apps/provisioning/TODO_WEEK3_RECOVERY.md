# TODO: WEEK 3 - RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION
# 
# Following virtualmin_review.md recommendations for recovery phase.
# DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET - Planning phase only.
#
# RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS:
# ===============================================================================
#
# 1. **Immutable Backups**
#    - Set up versioned, tamper-proof backups of Virtualmin account data
#    - Cross-reference with PRAHO database for integrity validation
#    - Geographic distribution (multiple regions)
#    - Point-in-time recovery capability
#
# 2. **Recovery Procedures Documentation**
#    - Step-by-step server rebuild procedures
#    - Data restoration workflows
#    - Network reconfiguration playbooks  
#    - DNS failover procedures
#
# 3. **Automated Recovery Testing**
#    - Monthly disaster recovery drills
#    - Backup integrity verification
#    - Recovery time measurement
#    - Data consistency validation
#
# 4. **Recovery Time Targets**
#    - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 4 hours maximum
#    - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour maximum
#    - MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery): 2 hours target
#    - Service availability: 99.9% uptime SLA
#
# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
# ===============================================================================
#
# Phase 3A: Backup Infrastructure
# - Implement VirtualminBackupService with encryption
# - Create backup verification and integrity checks
# - Set up cross-region backup replication
# - Build backup metadata tracking in PRAHO database
#
# Phase 3B: Recovery Automation  
# - Create VirtualminRecoveryService for account rebuilding
# - Implement server rebuilding from PRAHO-as-source-of-truth
# - Build automated DNS failover mechanisms
# - Create recovery orchestration workflows
#
# Phase 3C: Testing Infrastructure
# - Build disaster recovery testing framework
# - Create isolated recovery testing environments
# - Implement recovery time measurement tools
# - Build recovery success validation
#
# FILES TO CREATE:
# - apps/provisioning/backup_service.py
# - apps/provisioning/recovery_service.py  
# - apps/provisioning/management/commands/test_disaster_recovery.py
# - scripts/backup_verification.py
# - scripts/recovery_automation.py
#
# ESTIMATED EFFORT: 3-4 weeks full implementation
# DEPENDENCIES: Backup storage infrastructure, monitoring systems
