# TODO: WEEK 4 - VERIFICATION & RED TEAM TESTING
#
# Following virtualmin_review.md recommendations for verification phase.
# DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET - Planning phase only.
#
# VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
# ===============================================================================
#
# 1. **Red Team Exercise Planning**
#    - Simulated ACL authentication compromise scenarios
#    - API credential theft simulation
#    - Man-in-the-middle attack testing
#    - Social engineering resistance testing
#
# 2. **Detection Time Measurement**
#    - Mean Time To Detection (MTTD): Target < 5 minutes
#    - False positive rate: < 2% for security alerts
#    - Alert escalation chain validation
#    - Monitoring system resilience testing
#
# 3. **Recovery Time Validation** 
#    - Actual vs. target recovery times
#    - Recovery procedure effectiveness
#    - Data integrity post-recovery
#    - Service restoration completeness
#
# 4. **Lessons Learned Documentation**
#    - Security gap identification
#    - Process improvement recommendations
#    - Technology stack weaknesses
#    - Training and awareness gaps
#
# RED TEAM EXERCISE SCENARIOS:
# ===============================================================================
#
# Scenario 1: Compromised ACL Credentials
# - Attacker gains ACL user credentials
# - Monitor detection time for unusual API patterns
# - Test automatic fallback to master admin
# - Validate audit logging completeness
#
# Scenario 2: Master Admin Credential Theft
# - Attacker obtains master admin access
# - Test rate limiting effectiveness
# - Validate approval workflow bypass attempts
# - Monitor for privilege escalation attempts
#
# Scenario 3: SSH Access Compromise
# - Attacker gains SSH access to server
# - Test sudo command monitoring
# - Validate command execution logging
# - Test emergency access revocation
#
# Scenario 4: PRAHO Platform Compromise
# - Attacker gains access to PRAHO system
# - Test blast radius limitation
# - Validate data corruption detection
# - Test recovery from PRAHO compromise
#
# MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK:
# ===============================================================================
#
# Detection Metrics:
# - Time from attack start to first alert
# - Time from alert to human investigation
# - Time from investigation to containment
# - Accuracy of threat classification
#
# Response Metrics:
# - Time to isolate compromised systems
# - Time to revoke compromised credentials
# - Time to restore service availability
# - Customer impact duration
#
# Recovery Metrics:
# - Data integrity validation time
# - Service restoration time
# - Customer notification time
# - Post-incident analysis completion
#
# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
# ===============================================================================
#
# Phase 4A: Red Team Infrastructure
# - Set up isolated testing environment
# - Create attack simulation tools
# - Build measurement and monitoring tools
# - Establish testing protocols
#
# Phase 4B: Exercise Execution
# - Run planned attack scenarios
# - Measure detection and response times
# - Document findings and gaps
# - Test recovery procedures under pressure
#
# Phase 4C: Analysis & Improvement
# - Analyze attack simulation results
# - Identify security and process gaps
# - Update security controls and procedures
# - Plan follow-up testing cycles
#
# FILES TO CREATE:
# - tests/security/red_team_scenarios.py
# - apps/monitoring/attack_simulation.py
# - scripts/security_metrics_collection.py
# - docs/RED_TEAM_EXERCISE_RESULTS.md
# - docs/SECURITY_LESSONS_LEARNED.md
#
# ESTIMATED EFFORT: 2-3 weeks preparation + 1 week execution + 1 week analysis
# DEPENDENCIES: Red team personnel, isolated test environment, monitoring tools
