RefundService - Critical Financial System for PRAHO Platform
=============================================================

This service handles bidirectional synchronization between orders and invoices for refunds.
It ensures that refunding either an order OR an invoice automatically refunds the other,
maintaining data integrity across the financial system.

CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURES:
- Atomic transactions prevent partial refunds
- Comprehensive validation prevents double refunds
- Audit logging for regulatory compliance
- Strong typing throughout for reliability
- Result pattern for explicit error handling

BUSINESS RULES:
- Orders and invoices can be refunded independently 
- Refunding one automatically refunds the other
- Partial refunds are supported with amount tracking
- Refund eligibility is validated before processing
- Multiple invoices per order are handled correctly
